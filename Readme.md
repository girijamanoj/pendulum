Pendulum
========

What is Pendulum?
-----------------

Pendulum is nothing else than a simple phisics simulation fpr complex
pendulum (a chain of components).

The Pendulum project is a study project that realises subject called
"Techniques of computer simulations" on Technical University of Łódź.

What a Pendulum project assumes?
--------------------------------

There are two different types of objects:
 * metal stick, and
 * metal spring.

Those objects are conected into a random chain. Depending on simulation
starting conditions a bahavior of those elements will differ a lot.

Pendulum has to simulate behavior of such a chain of objects.

Technologies
------------

Pendulum is written in Python 2.7.1+ using PyOpenGL 3.0.1 and Tkinter 2.7.
