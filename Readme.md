Pendulum
========

What is Pendulum?
-----------------

Pendulum is nothing else than a simple phisics simulation for complex
pendulum (a chain of components).

The Pendulum project is a study project that realises subject called
"Techniques of computer simulations" on Technical University of Łódź.

What a Pendulum project assumes?
--------------------------------

There are two mathematical pendulums hanged one on the other (connected
into a chain). Depending on simulation starting conditions a bahavior of
those elements will differ.

Pendulum has to simulate behavior of such a chain of objects.

Technologies
------------

Pendulum is written in Python 2.7.1+ using PyOpenGL 3.0.1 and Tkinter 2.7.
